Remote Login
======================================

If you are away from the ACFI or can't login into the Physics wifi network, then there is a backdoor method for logging into titan. This consists of first logging into a server which is already onsite at LGRT called stepa0 and then, from there, logging into titan. To log onto stepa0, open a terminal and type ::

	ssh everybody@stepa0.physics.umass.edu

When prompted for a password, use **406Amherst**. Once into the remote server, then log into titan the standard way (see :doc:`getting_started`).

Automatic Login (Optional)
--------------------------------------

Logging into stepa0 first and then titan from there can get annoying after a little while with all the typing. In order to simplify the process somewhat, you can setup an automatic logins. To do this, open a terminal on your local machine and cd into your **~/.ssh** folder. Here, you can create a public/private rsa key pair by typing ::

	ssh-keygen

It will then give you the prompt: *Enter file in which to save the key*. I recommend choosing a convenient filename here, such as **id_rsa_umass**. You'll then be prompted for a passphrase. Just press enter without writing anything (no passphrase is assigned). This isn't needed as long as you're careful with your own local machine and it also allows you to call ssh from within a shell script. If this was successful, you should see something resembling the following

.. image:: rsapair_output.png

This process will create two files, **id_rsa_umass** and **id_rsa_umass.pub**. While still in the **~/.ssh** folder, open the config file with your favorite text editor (if no config file exists yet, just create it) and write the following lines at the end of it ::

	Host everybody
   		User everybody
   		Hostname stepa0.physics.umass.edu
   		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_umass
   		ServerAliveInterval 10

and save and close it. You now need to copy the public key to the remote host. To do this, type ::

	scp id_rsa_umass.pub everybody@stepa0.physics.umass.edu:~/.ssh/

using the above password when prompted and then ssh into stepa0 and cd into **~/.ssh**. You should now see your id_rsa_umass.pub key as well as an **authorized_keys2** file. In order to insert your public key into the list of authorized keys, type ::

	cat id_rsa_umass.pub >> authorized_keys2

We can now further simplify the step into titan by adding the following lines to the **config** file in the **~/.ssh** folder ::

	Host titan
		User username
		Hostname titan.physics.umass.edu

with **username** replaced with your chosen titan username. 

If you now start a new terminal on your local machine, you should be able to simply type ::

	ssh everybody

to get into stepa0 without a password from your local machine. Once there, you should be to type ::

	ssh titan

to log into titan, after you insert your titan password when prompted. 

**Note:** *it's possible to repeat the procedure to log into stepa0 without a password for titan as well. However, in the interest of security, I'd recommend against this.*
