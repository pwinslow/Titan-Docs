======================================
Welcome to Titan Docs!
======================================

This page is intended as a tutorial for using the titan cluster at UMass to perform parallelized simulations with MadGraph and CosmoTransitions. The titan cluster is maintained by `Joe Babcock <https://www.physics.umass.edu/people/joseph-babcock>`_ and `Ben Brau <https://www.physics.umass.edu/people/benjamin-brau>`_. 

For general questions about running simulations and any errors you see in the following tutorial, please contact `me <mailto:pwinslow@physics.umass.edu>`_. For general questions about titan, your first point of contact should be `Joe <mailto:babcock@physics.umass.edu>`_. However, if neither Joe or I can resolve your issue, you can also contact `Ben <mailto:bbrau@physics.umass.edu>`_. 

In the section, I'll describe the process of getting started with titan.
